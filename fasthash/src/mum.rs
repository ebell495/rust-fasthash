//! `MumHash`, Hashing functions and PRNGs based on them

//!
//! * MUM hash is a **fast non-cryptographic hash function**
//!   suitable for different hash table implementations
//! * MUM means **MU**ltiply and **M**ix
//!   * It is a name of the base transformation on which hashing is implemented
//!   * Modern processors have a fast logic to do long number multiplications
//!   * It is very attractable to use it for fast hashing
//!     * For example, 64x64-bit multiplication can do the same work as 32
//!       shifts and additions
//!   * I'd like to call it Multiply and Reduce.  Unfortunately, MUR
//!     (Multiply and Rotate) is already taken for famous hashing
//!     technique designed by Austin Appleby
//!   * I've chosen the name also as I am releasing it on Mother's day
//! * MUM hash passes **all** [`SMHasher`](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher) tests
//!   * For comparison, only 4 out of 15 non-cryptographic hash functions
//!     in `SMHasher` passes the tests, e.g. well known FNV, Murmur2,
//!     Lookup, and Superfast hashes fail the tests
//! * MUM algorithm is **simpler** than City64 and Spooky ones
//! * MUM is specifically **designed for 64-bit CPUs** (Sorry, I did not want to
//!   spend my time on dying architectures)
//!   * Still MUM will work for 32-bit CPUs and it will be sometimes
//!     faster Spooky and City
//! * On x86-64 MUM hash is **faster** than City64 and Spooky on all tests except for one
//!   test for the bulky speed
//!   * Starting with 240-byte strings, City uses Intel SSE4.2 crc32 instruction
//!   * I could use the same instruction but I don't want to complicate the algorithm
//!   * In typical scenario, such long strings are rare.  Usually another
//!     interface (see `mum_hash_step`) is used for hashing big data structures
//! * MUM has a **fast startup**.  It is particular good to hash small keys
//!   which are a majority of hash table applications
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
//!
//! use fasthash::{mum, MumHasher};
//!
//! fn hash<T: Hash>(t: &T) -> u64 {
//!     let mut s: MumHasher = Default::default();
//!     t.hash(&mut s);
//!     s.finish()
//! }
//!
//! let h = mum::hash64(b"hello world\xff");
//!
//! assert_eq!(h, hash(&"hello world"));
//! ```
